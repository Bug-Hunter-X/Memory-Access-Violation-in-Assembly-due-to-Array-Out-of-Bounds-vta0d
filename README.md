This repository demonstrates a common error in assembly programming: memory access violations caused by array index out-of-bounds errors. The `bug.asm` file contains code that attempts to access memory outside its allocated range, leading to a crash. The `bugSolution.asm` file provides a corrected version with bounds checking implemented to prevent this error.  This example highlights the importance of careful memory management and bounds checking in low-level programming languages like assembly.
